Cron service allows us to schedule commans to run at regular intervals or times

I am basically skipping this part as I am familiar. for work, I have a cron job set up to back up a database and send the database and folder of elements to another server for preservation. 

A good refernce I found for the syntax is https://crontab.guru/

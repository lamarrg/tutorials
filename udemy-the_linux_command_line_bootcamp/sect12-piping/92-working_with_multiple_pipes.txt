# can pipe output from a command to input of another and on and on...  following example will give more middle portions of list
> cat <filename> | head -7 | tail -5 

# example - find 3 largest files in directory
> ls /usr/bin -lh | sort -rhk 5 | head -3

# a "better" way for getting file sizes is the command "du"
> du -ha /usr/bin/ | sort -h

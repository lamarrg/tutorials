# where ever we put custom scripts, want to make sure its added to PATH.
# convention is to add directory to home directory called "bin" 

## some distributions look to see if a bin directory was added to users home   (in .profile)

### following is found in .profile from my digital ocean ubuntu installation
# set PATH so it includes user's private bin if it exists
if [ -d "$HOME/bin" ] ; then
    PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH"
fi


# manually add, open .bashrc and add the following line
PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH"

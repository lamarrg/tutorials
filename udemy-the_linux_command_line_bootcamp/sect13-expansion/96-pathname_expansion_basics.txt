# if you try to use "*" in an echo command, it will insert the names of the files in the specified directory. a form of wildcard

# also works with other commands. list all .txt files in a directory
> ls -l *.txt

# list files that start with "p"
> ls -l p*

# using multiple asterisks to list files with "at" in them
> ls -l *at*

# "?" wildcard represents excactly any single character
# if you want to match on an extension with 2 characters like .js, you will need to 
> ls -l <filename>.??


# range wildcards use square brackets ([]) like regex. looks like each bracket set represents a character
# [123] will match 1, 2, or 3. 
# [a-z] will match any lower case letter
# [0-9] will match any single digit

# to list for anything that starts with a capital letter
> ls [A-Z]*

# starts with a capital letter, but ends with one of 3 specific lowercase letters
> [A-Z]*[hpr]



# NEGATING RANGES
# inside square brackets can specify range of characters to NOT match, using a carat -> ^
> ls [^a]  (will match any files that do NOT start with "a")
> ls [^0-9]  (will match any files that do NOT start with a numeric digit "0-9")
> ls [^PpCc]  (will not match files that start with letters in the brackets)

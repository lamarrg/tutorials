# ability for find to run a command for us with every mathing pathname
# the syntax is -> find -exec command {};


-------------------
# prints list of empty files starting from home directory, and the file details for each (the ls portion is what is passed to the "exec" command )
> find ~ -type f -empty -exec ls -l '{}' ';'      # quotes around curly braces and semicolon are required


# if you want to delete multiple files you have found, using "ok" instead of "exec" will ask if you want to delete each file
-------------------
# find file names that end with ".html", and make a copy with "_COPY" at the end
> find -type f -name "*.html" -exec cp '{}' '{}_COPY' ';'

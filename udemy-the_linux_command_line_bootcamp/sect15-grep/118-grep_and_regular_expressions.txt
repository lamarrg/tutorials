# we can provide regular expressions to grep. helps us match complex patterns, but the syntax does differ from what we have seen so far


. - matches any single character
> grep 't...' <filename> -w     ## matches any WORD (-w) that starts with the letter t, and has 3 characters after

^ - matches the start of a line
> grep "^I" <filename> -w

$ - matches end of line
> grep "$)" <filename> -c    ## counting appearances

# chown - change ownership of user or group

# chown <user>[:<group>] <files>
> chown user_bob file.txt   (changes individual owner)

# regular users can't change ownership, must be done by sudo

# to change group, use colon ahead of group name
> chown :new_group file.txt


# can do both at same time...
> chown user_bob:new_group file.txt

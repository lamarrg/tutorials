# GIS in QGIS 3 for Beginners

This is another Udemy course, and hopefully I will find it more insightful as I have a little more understanding going into it. 




# Upon Completion

The course is complete!

I did not upload everything, so as not to infringe on the instructors content. The repo includes the modified project files and some requested output images. 

GIS is a broad reaching information filtering/extrapolation system. We only scratched the surface here, but that surface was still chock full of information.

I was unable to upload the original data files that would go in this folder as they are too large for my account. I have included locations of the files from the course about the files we used, but version numbers may change over time... 

Go to [Natural Earth Data Downloads](https://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/), select Large Scale Data, then "Cultural". Then the follwing files....

# chmod - change the permissions of a file or directory. (change mode)
# to use it, need to tell it:
# WHO we are changing permissions for
# WHAT change are we making/adding/removing
# WHICH permissions are we setting

# specify the who...
# u - user (the owner of the file)
# g - group (members of the group the file belongs to)
# o - others (the world)
# a - all the above

# then the what...
# - (minus sign) removes the permission
# + (plus sign) grants the permission
# = (equal sign) sets a permission and removes others

# the which... 
# r - read permission
# w - writer permission
# x - execute permission

# sample command
> chmod g+w <file or folder>   (adds group permission to write)
> chmod a-w <file of folder>   (removes write permission from all)
> chmod u+x <file or folder>   (add user execute)
> chmod a=r <file or folder>   (sets all to only be able to read)

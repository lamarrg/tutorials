# xargs - build and execute command lines from standard input

# cannot directly pipe results of a find (stdin) to "ls" command... 
# create a bundle to pipe to another command
# this will not work -> find -empty | ls       ## side note, this command hosed my server
# this one should work
> find -empty | xargs ls -l

# "find" command is far more powerful. by default, on its own will list EVERY single file and directory nested in current working directory. 

# to find total number of files and directories from where search is run...
> find | wc -l

# can direct to look in a specific folder
> find /etc/apt/
> find <folder in current directory>

# "type" can search for specific things...  "d" to find directories, "f" to find files. plus more
> find -type d 

# finding by name, use -name followed by the name in ""
> find <path> -name "<file name>"

# to ignore case, use -iname
